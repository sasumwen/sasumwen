## Hi, I’m Osasumwen Raphael Imarhiagbe (Osasu)

I’m a Machine Learning Engineer and applied AI researcher focused on building end-to-end intelligent systems that translate research into real-world impact.

### What I work on
- Large Language Models (LLMs), Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
- Adaptive learning systems and AI-driven education platforms
- Multimodal deep learning (vision + time-series)
- Scalable ML pipelines, deployment, and performance optimization

### Current Work
- **Machine Learning Engineer / Technical Lead at StudyRadar.ai**
  - Architected and shipped an AI-powered exam preparation platform
  - Built RAG pipelines, real-time STT/TTS, and automated feedback systems
  - Designed scalable, cost-aware ML infrastructure on GCP

- **Graduate Researcher (MSc Computer Science)**
  - Designed **BoRefAttnNet**, a boundary-refined 3D U-Net for medical image segmentation
  - Developed **DySTTM**, a dynamic spatial-temporal transformer for multimodal learning
  - Paper accepted for peer-reviewed publication

### High-Performance Computing
- Selected as **one of 10 Canadian researchers** by the Digital Research Alliance of Canada
- Attended the **2025 International High-Performance Computing Summer School (IHPCSS)** in Lisbon
- Training in GPU acceleration, parallel computing, and performance optimization

### Tech Stack
- Python, PyTorch, TensorFlow (Google TensorFlow Developer Certified)
- Transformers, RAG, FAISS, LangChain
- Docker, CI/CD, MLflow, GCP
- Research-to-production ML workflows

### About my GitHub
Most of my recent production work lives in **private repositories** due to IP and contractual constraints (e.g., StudyRadar.ai and consulting projects). Public repositories reflect research implementations, system prototypes, and experimental work. I am always happy to walk through architectures, design decisions, and trade-offs in detail.
